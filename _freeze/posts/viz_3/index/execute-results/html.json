I visualized the findings with `corrplot()`, one of my favorite packages.\n\nChi-square test is used to determine if the distribution of a sample is different from what we would expect by chance (Agresti, 2013). It helps researchers understand whether the differences between observed and expected counts are likely due to random variation (Morgan et al., 2020). Standardized residuals provide additional insight by showing how much the observed counts differ from the expected ones, considering the influence of independent variables on dependent variables (Chatterjee, 2011).\n\nThis is when I truly understood the power and flexibility of R, as it allowed me to present the story of the data through clear and intuitive visualizations.\n\nDo you notice how group 2 is overrepresented and group 7 is underrepresented in Attempts to Contact Unsuccessful (\"Disqualification\")? Also, group 7 is noticeably underrepresented in Part B Eligibility Not Determined (\"Not Determined\"), but the same group is overrepresented in Complete or Not Eligible (\"Not Eligible\"). Let's take a look at who these groups are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is my first attempt. Even though itâ€™s a bit messy, I was really impressed that I could run this analysis and create the visualization so easily.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncorrplot(chi_results$stdres, \n         is.cor = FALSE, \n         tl.cex = 0.7)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThen, I renamed the columns and rows, and experimented with different plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# corrplot(chi_results$stdres, \n#         is.cor = FALSE, \n#         tl.cex = 0.3)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# corrplot(chi_results$stdres, \n#         is.cor = FALSE, \n#         tl.cex = 0.6)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncorrplot(chi_results$stdres, \n         method = 'square', \n         is.cor = FALSE, \n         tl.cex = 0.6)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# corrplot(chi_results$stdres, \n#         method = 'ellipse', \n#         is.cor = FALSE, \n#         tl.cex = 0.6)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# corrplot(chi_results$stdres, \n#       is.cor = FALSE, \n#        tl.cex = 0.8, \n#         cl.cex = 0.7, \n#         cl.offset = 0.5) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\nI finally settled on this version after moving the label numbers a bit further out to make them easier to read. I also reordered the exit categories alphabetically at the top, which makes the chart look a bit different from my original attempt.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncorrplot(chi_results$stdres, \n         is.cor = FALSE, \n         tl.cex = 0.8, \n         cl.cex = 0.7,     \n         cl.offset = 1,    \n         cl.ratio = 0.2)    \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
